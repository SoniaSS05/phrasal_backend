This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Objective:

-- Through the application the users will learn the meaning of Phrasal Verbs
 in English, keeping the list of Phrasal Verbs that users have already learned.

MVP ASAP:

As a user, I can:
